 Revision history for Perl extension Data::Types.

0.03  
        - Fixed to_float() tests so that comparison is more precise. Necessary
          for compatability with Perl 5.8.0 (and probably better, anyway).
        - Reorganized structure of distribution to reflect more modern standard
          for CPAN modules.

        - Added second argument to to_string() that will truncate the string.
        - Fixed Regular expression in is_int() so that it doesn't match '+' or
          '-'. Thanks to David Alban for the spot.
