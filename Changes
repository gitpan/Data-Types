Revision history for Perl extension Data::Types.

0.05    Tue Aug 26 01:21:03 2003
        - Switched to Module::Build.

0.04    Thu Jul 25 05:09:13 2002
        - Added reference to Arthur Bergman's new "types" pragma for Perl
          5.8.0. Thought I'd done it in 0.03, but I guess not.

0.03  Mon Jul 22 21:05:26 2002
        - Fixed to_float() tests so that comparison is more precise. Necessary
          for compatability with Perl 5.8.0 (and probably better, anyway).
        - Reorganized structure of distribution to reflect more modern standard
          for CPAN modules.

0.02  Thu Jan  3 22:06:42 PST 2002
        - Added second argument to to_string() that will truncate the string.
        - Fixed Regular expression in is_int() so that it doesn't match '+' or
          '-'. Thanks to David Alban for the spot.

0.01  Wed Jan  2 12:13:19 PST 2002
        - original version.
